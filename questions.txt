# Team Lead Engineer — Technical Assessment - questions
===========
Question 1.
===========
A client reports that conversion dropped about 20% after our last deploy. Our stack includes Shopify, CheckoutChamp CRM, our dashboards, and a new A/B sales funnel (Checkout + 3 Upsell/Downsell pages).
 
> In 3–6 short steps, how would you run the investigation? 
(what would you do, in what order, and who would own what if you have a small team)

> What’s the first place you’d look in our stack and why?



===========
Question 2.
===========
The team is using AI coding tools.

> What guidelines or guardrails would you set so AI use improves quality and speed without increasing risk?
(e.g. review requirements, testing, security)



===========
Question 3.
===========
You have 2 engineers with bandwidth for 6 weeks to deliver: client portal + internal dashboard + payment routing prototype.

> What do you build first, what do you defer, and why?
> Provide a 6-week plan with milestones and risks.










===========
# Task 1. Code in attached repo (5 min)
===========
Open `codebase/routes/orders.js` (your version after fixes).

> In your own words: what was wrong with the original `syncOrder` logic (before your fixes), and why did those issues matter for production?
> What did you change first and why that order?



===========
# Task 2. Code in attached repo (5 min)
===========
Open `codebase/routes/funnel.js`. Reference original file for this question; Just review it.

> List 2–3 specific risks or bugs in `recordFunnelStep` (security, correctness, or reliability). Be specific (e.g. “X could happen because Y”).
> What would you add or change first before this code goes to production, and why that order?



===========
